This is the Race "Fungi" from my mod Mushrooms and Shroomans.

I´m currently redrawing everything in 512x512 and i thought that it would be a good idea to release only the race without their f´ed up stuff.
Currently, they got 18 different faces. 


Once enslaved , mistreated , torturted and cursed with a life expectancy of 15 years, after a violent escape, the Fungi simply slowly forgot their past over thousands of years. Now they are in a tribal stage , just trying to survive.
Scientists claim that they are genetically altered humans. No one remembers what happened back then. At least in this region of the galaxy.


Nearly all of them are night owls
They dont mind being naked 
They can not wear hats, due to their many different heads.
They can only wear vanilla stuff, i had to forbid everything cause hats are not classified as hats and added all vanilla clothings after that.
They eat from corpses too , they don´t mind eating humanoid meat (Only cooked, they are no animals :D)
They like it hot , they have a hard time surviving cold habitats.
The Fungi are often accompanied by their beloved shroomimals.
Shroomimals can sting with their Tail , causing a flesh eating spore infection, which lets the victim endure high pain and they puke all the time. It´s a tendable Infection. If not treated, the victim will die fast.


Obviously, you need Humanoid Alien Races 2.0, Big Credits to Erdelf for making other races possible.

If you want to play that race , just pick the scenario : " Oh look! Shroomies! "</description>
